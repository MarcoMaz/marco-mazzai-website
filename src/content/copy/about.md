I'm Marco, a **certified Accessibility** and **Front End Developer**.
I specialize in creating **beautiful accessible web products** and **design systems** for clients worldwide.
This site is built with **Astro**, **React**, and **Wa11y** — my own accessible component library. It's a working example of the standards I maintain: WCAG compliant, performant, and built with some of the tools I use for enterprise clients.

## My Journey

I didn't always work in tech. For years, I was a drum teacher. When I needed a website for my lessons, I grabbed a WordPress template and started tweaking CSS. I fell in love with code and never looked back.
I moved into frontend development, starting in Berlin agencies and scaling up to leading enterprise design systems. Along the way, I discovered accessibility, and it became a core focus of my work.

## What I Believe

Good design systems empower teams without constraining them. Components should be flexible, well-tested, and properly documented. And accessibility isn't about compliance—it's about craftsmanship. Building things that work for everyone is just better work.

## Currently

- Pursuing IAAP WAS certification
- Maintaining Wa11y, my accessible component library
- Writing about accessibility best practices and frontend in general
